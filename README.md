# Godot debug builds

This repository contains *debug* builds of the Godot editor with full debugging
information. Most optimizations are disabled to make backtraces more useful.
You want to use an [optimized build](https://godotengine.org/download/) for
production, as it'll feel significantly snappier.

Windows binaries were compiled with Visual Studio Community 2019 (version 16.4.3).
